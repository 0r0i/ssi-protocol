# ssi-protocol/msg/std

This folder documents standard messages of general interest,
foundational to any SSI work. For example, an error message, messages to
query and reply about the capabilities of another entity, messages about
issuing credentials or proving things, or messages about how to route
other messages. Messages are organized into __message families__ by subdir
-- so there might be a subdir called `cred_issuance`, for example.
