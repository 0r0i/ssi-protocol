# ssi-protocol/flow

This folder holds docs on different interaction patterns that might matter in
the ecosystem. Some of these patterns may related to specific message families;
others may apply to many different message types.
  
  * [`/flow/std`](std/README.md) -- Standard interaction patterns of general
  interest, foundational to any SSI work. For example, the `negotiate` pattern
  or the `consent` pattern may apply broadly enough to qualify as a standard flow.
  
  * [`/flow/ext`](ext/README.md) -- Flow families of narrower interest, such
  as the flow that occurs in a shopping cart checkout.
